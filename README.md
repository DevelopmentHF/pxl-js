# PXL-JS ✏️

## Overview

![Site Picture](sample.png)

`PXL-JS` is a simplistic web-based pixel art tool <br>

It was made as part of the curriculum of `The Odin Project` <br>

<br>

<br>

## Current Features
The site in its current form has the ability to draw on an adjustable canvas and erase the content, which is limited to black pixels for now.

<br>

In future, I would like to expand on this project, by adding the ability to export the drawn image, and add the ability to use different colours <br>


As my ability increases, I also hope to add tools such as marquee selection and shape-restricted drawing (square tool etc)
